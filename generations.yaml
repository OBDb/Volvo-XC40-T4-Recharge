    description: "The Volvo XC40 T4 Recharge is a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant of Volvo's compact luxury crossover, introduced in 2020 as part of the company's electrification strategy. Based on the conventional XC40, it combines a 1.5-liter three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine (B3154T10) with an electric motor for a combined output of approximately 211 horsepower. The T4 Recharge is front-wheel drive only, distinguishing it from the more powerful T5 Recharge PHEV which offered all-wheel drive. The electric motor is powered by a 10.7 kWh lithium-ion battery pack enabling an electric-only range of approximately 27-28 miles (44-45 km) on the WLTP cycle. Visually, the T4 Recharge is distinguished from conventional XC40 models by specific badges and the addition of a charging port on the front fender. The interior features Volvo's distinctive Scandinavian design with high-quality materials, a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and numerous clever storage solutions. Safety features are comprehensive, including City Safety collision avoidance, Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, and numerous advanced driver assistance systems. The XC40 T4 Recharge served as an entry point to Volvo's electrified lineup, offering reduced emissions and the ability to complete short commutes on electric power alone. Production ended in 2023 as Volvo shifted focus to fully electric models like the EX40."
